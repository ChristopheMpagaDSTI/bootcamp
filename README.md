# Bootcamp

This repository contains prerequisites for the python and R warmups, informations on the course schedule, and additional resources to go further.

## python

#### The course is an initiation to data structures and algorithm with numpy, pandas and scikit-learn, and will cover the following topics: 

      - Intermediate data structures and algorithms
      - Understanding numpy arrays
      - Exploratory data analysis and visualisation with pandas
      - Initiation to data science

- To prepare for the class, you can read and exercise with 
[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), cloning the repository or exercising with the online version of the book


- **If you're a complete beginner in python, please make sure you have reviewed the [1-learning-path-python](https://github.com/tiptales/bootcamp/tree/main/1-learning-path-python) chapter** and that you have at least covered [1.2-prerequisites](https://github.com/tiptales/bootcamp/tree/main/1-learning-path-python/1.2-prerequisites) by yourself, and done the associated exercises before going to class.

- If you're experienced in python, and already familiar with the three libraries used during the bootcamp([1.3-data-specifics](https://github.com/tiptales/bootcamp/tree/main/1-learning-path-python/1.3-data-specifics)), you can try to implement one of the [projects](https://github.com/tiptales/bootcamp/tree/main/3-projects/). The projects are not mandatory, they will be discussed at the end of the class with sudents who implemented them.
